# Barebones Frotz platform

a return to the golden era of bootable games

This builds a floppy image that can be booted in a VM to run a .z5 program

## To build:

1. get a .z5 file and name it zcode.z5 (I used random.z5 from the frotz tests)
2. make
3. Create a virtualbox VM with fzos-floppy.bin in the floppy drive.
4. launch the VM

## TODO:

* add the NOTIMPLs
* create keyboard handler
